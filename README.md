# Introduction to Tableau

This workshop and the materials in this repo are for anyone who is interested in working with Tableau to produce high quality, interactive data visualizations!

Everyone is welcome, whether you are completely new to Tableau or have some amount of experience, as we will begin with the very basics of using this tool and progress to more advanced techniques.

Topics covered will include visualization best practices, utilizing calculated fields, data preparation techniques, working with multiple measures, and creating drill down variables.
