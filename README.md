# Introduction to Tableau

This workshop and the materials in this repo are for anyone who is interested in working with Tableau to produce high quality, interactive data visualizations!

Everyone is welcome, whether you are completely new to Tableau or have some amount of experience, as we will begin with the very basics of using this tool and progress to more advanced techniques.

Topics covered will include utilizing calculated fields, data preparation techniques, working with multiple measures, and creating drill down variables.

Download one of the following to be able to make your own workbook:
* Tableau Public (always free) - make an account and then download the app: https://public.tableau.com
* Tableau Desktop (free trial): https://tableau.com/products/desktop/download

Optional - If you would like to follow along for the brief Python in Tableau demonstration, you will need to install TabPy: https://github.com/tableau/TabPy

Note that Tableau only has apps for Mac & Windows.

If you are not attending the workshop in person, but would like still to work your way through this repo, you can open the TableauWorkshop2018.twbx file and work your way through replicating the visualizations.
